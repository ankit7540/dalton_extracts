  Set of bash scripts to extract wavelength dependent polarizability from DALTON output and make a matrix of polarizabilities where rows are arranged along distance ( internuclear) while columns represent different wavelegths.
  
  `idata_allDynamic.sh` processes DALTON output where polarizabilities for non-zero wavelengths were requested (i.e. no static value).
