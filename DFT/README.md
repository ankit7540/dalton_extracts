**Scripts for extracting properties from DALTON DFT output**
------------------------------------------------------------

Shell scripts and python codes which extract dipole moment, polarizability and hyperpolarizability from the DALTON DFT output. The extracted numbers are formatted as IgorPro's itx file which allow them to be imported in IgorPro for further analysis. Of course the code can be modified to export to other kind of files.
